    <h2>Must Have Games</h2>
    <p>
      Here I'll highlight some of the games you should consider if you're new to collecting from the SNES. I will of course mention the usual classics, but I'll try to throw in some leftfield picks to keep things interesting!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiny Toon Adventures was one of the early 90s classics. It's often overshadowed by Animaniacs in the early 90s cartoon pantheon, but the Tiny Toons Games were much better. This SNES entry, developed by Konami is a bit of odd one. It's a mish mash of different gameplay styles, but primarily a platformer. You play as Buster Bunny on his mission to defeat Montana Max. Your journey starts at Acme Tooniversity, but takes you through the Wild West, a Haunted mansion, an American football game, and even to space in the game's Star Wars pastiche. There are some fun mini games between levels inclduding sliding tile puzzles, an overhead maze game and that game of pure chance - Bingo. Definitely worth a look, it has tight and responsive controls, great music and looks just like the cartoon it's based on!

    <h3>Tiny Toon Adventures is a challenging licensed platformer from Konami with bright, cartoony visuals.</h3>
    <p>
      Next on this list is the original Super Mario Kart. This game single handedly invented the kart racing sub genre. It has certainly been surpassed by later entries, but all the ingredients we know and love are present and correct here. Items, fantastic themed tracks, all your the classic Mario characters, some great music, and arguably the series best battle mode! For my money, this game is superior to Mario Kart 64 and Double Dash, but not quite as good as Super Circuit DS, 7 or 8. Definitely worth a look, and not just for nostalgia.

    <h3>Super Mario Kart invented the kart racing sub genre</h3>
    <p>
      Super Mario World was a revelation back in the day... It took everything that made Super Mario Bros 3 great (except perhaps the item diversity) and expanded upon it. It arguably introduced adventure and puzzle aspects to Mario. There were of course secrets to find in even the first Mario game, but this one really rewarded lateral thinking and thoroughly exploring the environment. One of the most ingenious secrets requiring the player to jump into the void beneath the level goal, and jump from Yoshi's back (there's a million of them so don't feel too bad!), up past the goal to find a second goal. One of the beefiest and most polished platforming experienced money can buy, and still arguably the greatest 2D Mario game of all time!

  <h3>Quite possibly the greatest platformer ever made.</h3>
  <p>
    A fighting game is an essential addition to any SNES collection. Mortal Kombat may have briefly outshone it with its blood and gore shock value, but Street Fighter was always the better game. But which Street Fighter? Now this one was a difficult choice. Street Fighter 2 was a fantastic game, but the Stree Fighter 2 Turbo, Hyper Fighting update made the original completely irrelevant. With the ability to play in multiple hyper speed settings and select the original game's bosses, Balrog, Vega, Sagat and M. Bison, it is arguably the definitive SNES fighting game. Super Street Fighter 2 added an additional 4 characters, fan favorite Cammy, Bruce Lee rip off Fei Long, R. Hawk (...), and Dee Jay (...). Turbo wins out because half of those characters are terrible, the voices and announcers just sound all wrong, and Super lacks the Turbo speed settings. You can't really go wrong with any of them, but SF2 is probably the best of the SNES ports and one of the essential 2 player SNES experiences.

  <h3>This game put fighting games on the map</h3>
  <p>
    Super Metroid is possibly the best example of its sub genre, "Metroidvania" from which it inherited half of its name (the other half being Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, a game which borrows liberally from Super Metroid to craft a masterpiece of its own). Looking at screenshots, Metroid doesn't actually look all that impressive. It looks dark, dull and little bland, filled with gloomy, rocky caves and industrial complexes. Metroid is a game you have to play to understand, and when you do, it's difficult not to fall in love! Metroid is mechanially like a 2D Zelda game. You still explore a giant world, looking for secrets and new areas to explore, you gradually obtain new tools and weapons that allow you to reach previously unreachable areas and explore deeper into the planet, but everything is viewed in a sidescrolling perspective. The atmosphere is very reminiscent of Alien, or the more recent Prometheus or Alien Covenant films in particular. Moody, dark and uneasy. Samus gradually grows from vulnerable and underpowered to an overpowered demi Goddess by the game's finale, but the challenge level ramps up nicely to keep you on your toes. There's a very strong argument to make for this being the best entry in the Metroid series, and I certainly wouldn't disagree with any such claims! A masterpiece!

  <h3>More than any other game, Super Metroid has stood the test of time</h3>
  <p>
    A Link to the Past was an early peak for the Zelda series. Link to the Past fully realised the vision and potential of the Zelda formula as imagined in the 1986 original. It's hard to fault the game. Mechanically it is rock solid, has amazing music that is still being remixed and recycled in modern Zelda titles. Visually it's beautiful, colourful, vibrant, cartoony as all the best SNES games are, but it also nails dark, moody scenes, such as the games opening. The world is a treat to explore, wonderfully bizarre, with an interesting cast of charming weirdos populating it. There's no reason not to add this to your collection

  <h3>Many people still believe this is the best entry in the Zelda franchise</h3>
  <p>
    Another leftfield entry here withe Goof Troop. This was actually Shinji Mikami, of Resident Evil fame's first game, and quite a charming little action puzzler it is too! Graphically it's not the most impressive thing in the world, but it's a fantastic two player co-op game. One player takes control of Goofy, and the other his son Max. Together they explore an isaland that has been overrun by Pete and his pirate crew, using a variety of items and solving puzzles with some light combat

  <h3>It won't blow your socks off, but it's great cooperative fun!</h3>
  <p>
    Cybernator is probably the best mech game on the SNES.The robot that you pilot has a pleasing heft to it, it really feels something big and heavy, but also very maneuverable. This game is actually a sequel to the Megadrive game Target Earth, although the story takes place 10 years before that game. It's a wonderfully cathartic action platformer, with nice gameplay variety, great visuals for such an early SNES game, and a superb soundtrack!
